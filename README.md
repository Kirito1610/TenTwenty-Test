Next.js + TypeScript Project 🚀

This is a Next.js project built with TypeScript from the ground up.
I’ve set up everything manually to ensure flexibility, scalability, and performance.

✨ Features

⚡ Next.js + TypeScript – Strongly typed, production-ready framework.

🎨 Tailwind CSS – Installed and configured from scratch.

🔍 Basic SEO setup – Added meta tags and configuration for better discoverability.

🧩 Components architecture – All reusable elements/components live inside the components/ folder.

🎭 Smooth animations – Added subtle transitions and animations for a better user experience.

🎞 GSAP animations – Used GSAP for advanced animations on the second section.

📱 Responsive design – Fully responsive across desktop and mobile.

🎛 Custom configuration – Centralized configs created from zero for easy maintenance.

🎨 Styles folder – All style-related files are organized under styles/.
